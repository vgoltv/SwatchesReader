It is a simple iOS app to view GIMP color palettes saved as a *.gpl files. Swift.
Additionally it has Thumbnails and QuickLook extensions. They are written on a Objective-C just because taken from my other personal commercial project - ColorFinder, and a bit simplified.
Basically it is possible to add another formats, convert from one to another, edit them, but it is a completely another story.
The main goal to wrote it was to slighty play with the SwiftUI2 possibilities.
