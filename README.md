# SwatchesReader

Simple iOS app to view GIMP color palettes saved as a *.gpl files. Written mostly in Swift.

## Overview
Reading of GIMP color palettes *.gpl. The app also has included fast worked Thumbnails and QuickLook extensions. 


- Note: Extensions are written on Objective-C just because taken from my other personal commercial project - ColorFinder, and a bit simplified.
Basically it is possible to add another formats, convert from one to another, edit them, but it is a completely another story.
The main goal to wrote it was to slighty play with the SwiftUI2 possibilities.
